Breast cancer is one of the most common and deadly types on cancer in the United States. Breast cancer occurs when an abnormal growth of cells occurs, forming a tumor in onesâ€™ breasts. The classification of tumors can fall into two categories: benign and malignant, benign meaning that the tumor is not dangerous and malignant meaning that the tumors is cancerous and can invade nearby tissue. Detecting breast cancer in its early stages can greatly improve the chances of recovery as you can begin treatment before too much damage has been done.
	In this project, my goal is to take a dataset of individuals who have been diagnosed as benign or malignant and to train a model using the predictors to analyze and predict whether a certain individual would be classified as benign or malignant.
	The dataset I will be using is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set which can be found on Kaggle1. The dataset has 569 observations with 29 predictors, all of which are numerical. The predictors describe the various cell features of a tumor including the radius, texture, perimeter, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension. The target attribute is labeled as Diagnosis and is a categorical variable with two possible values of B for benign and M for malignant. There are no missing values.
I will be applying classification techniques such as KNN or decision trees to try and classify an individual as benign or malignant. I will also be applying clustering techniques to try and predict the diagnosis.
